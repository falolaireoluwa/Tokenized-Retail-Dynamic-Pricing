# Tokenized Retail Dynamic Pricing System

A blockchain-based system for implementing dynamic pricing strategies in retail environments using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

The Tokenized Retail Dynamic Pricing System enables retailers to adjust product prices dynamically based on real-time market demand and consumer behavior. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system provides transparency, security, and automation for retail pricing strategies.

## System Components

The system consists of five core smart contracts:

1. **Retailer Verification Contract**
   - Manages retailer registration and verification
   - Controls which merchants can participate in the system
   - Maintains a registry of verified retailers

2. **Product Registration Contract**
   - Handles product listings and details
   - Links products to their respective retailers
   - Stores base pricing information

3. **Demand Tracking Contract**
   - Monitors consumer interest through views and interactions
   - Tracks purchase patterns and frequency
   - Provides data for price optimization algorithms

4. **Price Optimization Contract**
   - Implements dynamic pricing algorithms
   - Adjusts prices based on demand metrics
   - Ensures pricing remains within acceptable thresholds

5. **Revenue Analytics Contract**
   - Records sales data and transaction history
   - Analyzes pricing effectiveness
   - Provides insights for future pricing strategies

## Architecture

The contracts are designed to work together in a modular fashion:
